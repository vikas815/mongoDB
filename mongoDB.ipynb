    "#1. Key Differences Between SQL and NoSQL Databases\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "- Structured schema with tables and rows.\n",
    "- Uses SQL for queries.\n",
    "- Follows ACID properties.\n",
    "- Suitable for structured data.\n",
    "- Vertical scaling (adding more resources to a single server).\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "- Schema-less, stores data in JSON-like format.\n",
    "- Uses various query mechanisms (not SQL).\n",
    "- More flexible, supports horizontal scaling.\n",
    "- Suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "- Eventual consistency instead of strict ACID compliance.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. What Makes MongoDB a Good Choice for Modern Applications?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Schema flexibility (JSON-like documents).\n",
    "- High scalability (horizontal scaling with sharding).\n",
    "- High availability (automatic replication).\n",
    "- Efficient querying with indexing.\n",
    "- Ideal for real-time applications like IoT and analytics.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Concept of Collections in MongoDB\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "A collection in MongoDB is similar to a table in SQL databases. It holds multiple documents (records) but does not enforce a strict schema, allowing flexible data storage.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. How MongoDB Ensures High Availability Using Replication\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- MongoDB uses Replica Sets to ensure high availability.\n",
    "- A replica set consists of a primary node and multiple secondary nodes.\n",
    "- If the primary node fails, an election takes place, and a secondary node is promoted to primary.\n",
    "- This ensures minimal downtime and data redundancy.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Main Benefits of MongoDB Atlas\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Fully managed cloud database service.\n",
    "- Automated backups and scaling.\n",
    "- High availability with global replication.\n",
    "- Built-in security features like encryption.\n",
    "- Easy integration with cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Role of Indexes in MongoDB and Performance Improvement\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Indexes speed up query execution by allowing efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "- Without indexes, MongoDB performs a full collection scan.\n",
    "- Index types include single-field, compound, multikey, text, and geospatial indexes.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Stages of MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- `$match`: Filters documents based on conditions.\n",
    "- `$group`: Groups documents and applies aggregations.\n",
    "- `$project`: Shapes the output document.\n",
    "- `$sort`: Sorts documents based on fields.\n",
    "- `$limit`: Limits the number of results.\n",
    "- `$lookup`: Performs joins between collections.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. What is Sharding in MongoDB? How It Differs from Replication\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- **Sharding**: Distributes data across multiple servers to handle large datasets and high traffic.\n",
    "- **Replication**: Creates copies of data for high availability and redundancy.\n",
    "- Sharding enables horizontal scaling, while replication ensures fault tolerance.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. What is PyMongo, and Why is It Used?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- PyMongo is the Python driver for MongoDB.\n",
    "- Used to connect, query, and manage MongoDB from Python applications.\n",
    "- Provides an easy-to-use API for working with MongoDB collections and documents.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. ACID Properties in MongoDB Transactions\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- **Atomicity**: Ensures complete transactions.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Maintains database integrity.\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Ensures independent transactions.\n",
    "- **Durability**: Data remains after a system crash.\n",
    "- Transactions in MongoDB (introduced in v4.0) provide ACID compliance for multi-document operations.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 11. Purpose of MongoDB’s `explain()` Function\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Used to analyze query performance.\n",
    "- Provides execution statistics and index usage.\n",
    "- Helps optimize slow queries.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 12. How MongoDB Handles Schema Validation\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Schema validation rules are set using JSON Schema.\n",
    "- Enforces structure while maintaining flexibility.\n",
    "- Helps prevent incorrect data insertion.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 13. Difference Between Primary and Secondary Node in a Replica Set\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- **Primary Node**: Accepts write operations.\n",
    "- **Secondary Nodes**: Replicate data from the primary.\n",
    "- If the primary fails, a secondary is elected as the new primary.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 14. Security Mechanisms in MongoDB\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Authentication and authorization (role-based access control).\n",
    "- Encryption at rest and in transit.\n",
    "- Network security (firewalls, IP whitelisting).\n",
    "- Auditing and logging.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 15. Embedded Documents and When to Use Them\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Stores related data within a single document.\n",
    "- Reduces the need for joins and improves performance.\n",
    "- Ideal for one-to-few relationships (e.g., user profile with address data).\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 16. Purpose of `$lookup` Stage in Aggregation\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Performs joins between collections.\n",
    "- Useful for combining data from multiple sources.\n",
    "- Similar to SQL’s JOIN operation.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 17. Common Use Cases for MongoDB\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Real-time analytics.\n",
    "- Internet of Things (IoT).\n",
    "- Content management systems.\n",
    "- E-commerce and inventory management.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",

    "# 18. Advantages of MongoDB for Horizontal Scaling\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Uses sharding to distribute data across multiple servers.\n",
    "- Improves performance and storage capacity.\n",
    "- Enables handling of large datasets efficiently.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 19. How MongoDB Transactions Differ from SQL Transactions\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- SQL transactions are strictly ACID-compliant by default.\n",
    "- MongoDB introduced multi-document ACID transactions in v4.0.\n",
    "- MongoDB transactions require explicit session handling.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 20. Differences Between Capped Collections and Regular Collections\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- **Capped Collections**:\n",
    "  - Fixed-size, circular storage.\n",
    "  - Automatically removes oldest data.\n",
    "  - Suitable for logging.\n",
    "- **Regular Collections**:\n",
    "  - No size restriction.\n",
    "  - Supports normal CRUD operations.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 21. Purpose of `$match` Stage in Aggregation Pipeline\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Filters documents based on conditions.\n",
    "- Improves performance by reducing data early in the pipeline.\n",

    "\n",
    "# 22. How to Secure Access to a MongoDB Database\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Use authentication and authorization.\n",
    "- Enable encryption and TLS/SSL.\n",
    "- Restrict IP access.\n",
    "- Regularly audit logs.\n",

    "- WiredTiger is the default storage engine in MongoDB.\n",
